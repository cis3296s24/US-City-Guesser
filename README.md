# US City Guessing Game

Welcome to the US City Guessing Game. Test your knowledge of US cities!

# Introduction

What a fun way to test your knowledge of US Cities. You'll be presented with information about a particular city with unlimited guesses and your task is to guess the correct city that computer picks in random.

# Instructions

To find the correct city, type a guess in the search box, click it, and hit "submit guess".
A dot will appear on the map where your guess displays the guessed city attempt. The distance to the target city will be listed below the map with calculation of how far off you are to the target city. As you get closer to it, the dots will become more red, which is like saying you're getting "hotter". Use this data to help yourself find the correct city destination. When you finally guess the correct targeted city, a dot will be displayed in green over the targeted city. Once you complete the game, you can click "restart" to play again!

Good luck!!!
