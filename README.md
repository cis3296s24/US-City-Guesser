# US City Guessing Game

Welcome to the US City Guessing Game. Test your knowledge of US cities!

# Introduction

What a fun way to test your knowledge of US Cities. You'll be presented with clues about a particular city after a few guesses and your task is to guess the correct city either with or without the clues.

# Instructions

The first 2 attempts/guesses will be without hints to see if the guests can guess the US city right from our randomized data. After the first 2 attempts incorrect, then we provide our first hints provided. Same 2 attempts afterwards again incorrect, then we provide our final hints provided to give our guests one last guess before it becomes revealed.

5 points without a clue
3 points with 1st clue
1 point with 2nd clue
0 if someone either gives up or already used up the 5 guesses attempt
